This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications caused by incorrect integration of third-party libraries with React Native's component lifecycle. The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code where a third-party library attempts to access a component's state before it's fully mounted. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by using lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` to ensure the library interacts with the component at the appropriate times.  The issue is particularly important when dealing with libraries that perform asynchronous operations or maintain internal state.
