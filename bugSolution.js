The solution involves using React Native's lifecycle methods to ensure the third-party library interacts with the component at the appropriate time. Here's how to fix it:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ThirdPartyLibrary from 'some-third-party-library'; // Replace with your library

class MyComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    this.thirdPartyInstance = new ThirdPartyLibrary(); // Initialize the library
    this.thirdPartyInstance.fetchData().then(data => {
      this.setState({ data });
    });
  }

  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Clean up the library's resources
    this.thirdPartyInstance.cleanup();
  }

  render() {
    const { data } = this.state;
    return (
      <View>
        {data ? <Text>{data}</Text> : <Text>Loading...</Text>}
      </View>
    );
  }
}

export default MyComponent;
```

This ensures the library is initialized after the component mounts and its resources are cleaned up before unmounting, avoiding lifecycle-related crashes or unexpected behavior.
